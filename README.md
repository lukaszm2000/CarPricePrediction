# Car price prediction
This project aims to predict car prices using various regression models. Data for the project was downloaded from Kaggle and then subjected to cleaning, visualization and regression model creation processes to accurately predict prices.

# Project description
1. Data download:
  The data was downloaded from Kaggle and contains various car characteristics such as make, model, year of registration, engine capacity, etc.
  
2. Data cleaning:
  The data was cleaned by filling in missing values, removing duplicates and correcting inaccuracies.
  Feature engineering was performed to create new, relevant features and transform existing ones to improve model performance.

4. Data visualization:
  A dashboard was created using the streamlit library in order to visualize the most important features - to run the dashboard, enter the streamllit run cars_visualization.py command in the terminal.

5. Creating models:
  Many regression models have been created to predict car prices, including:
  -Linear Regression
  -Decision Tree Regression
  -Random Forest Regression

  The performance of the models was assessed using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and coefficient of determination (R-squared).
  
5. Model results:
  The models were compared based on their performance metrics.
  The best performing model was selected to predict car prices using new data.
